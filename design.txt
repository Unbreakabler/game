ROUGELIKE GAMEPLAY MECHANIC:


- monsters have monster type specific drop tables

- players get to influence the moster types every run through choices that only reset on prestige
	- Maybe every 10 levels there is a prompt to choose some type of enemy upgrade path.
	- In order to ahve enough variety waves will need to be composed of multiple enemy types
		- in order for this to work wave generation will have to change to be generated but a group of weights that corresponding to monster types, then each wave will pick an appropriate amount of monsters from each pool.
	- In order for this to feel "good" I need to add a lot more monsters to the game of various types.

- this gives players the ability to target farm certain resources/upgrades/items (not sure what the loot will be yet), on each run.


TOWER SKILL MECHANIC:

- A "tower" is a made of up of a set of components
	- each component can hook into a "tower" life cycle method
		- Lifecyles are : On fire, On hit, on kill, After X (time period (on hit + timeout))
	- each component can hook "tower" attributes, the attributes will be passed through all component modifier functions.
- Components can spawn new gameobjects in life cycle methods.
	- exmaples:
		- on fire, shoot multiple projectiles
		- on fire, shoot projectiles in nova
		- on fire, 
		- on hit, generate a new circle collision enabled gameboject in order to do AOE damage.
		- on kill, generate a new circle collision enabled gameobject that spreads a debuff.
		- on hit, have a chance to shoot an additional projectile
		- on hit, have a chance to chain
		- on hit, have a chance to shoot lightning
		- on hit, have a chance to debuff enemy
			- fire - burning damage
			- lightning - shock
			- piercing - break armour
			- cold - slow enemy
	- exmaples that should be attribute mods:
		- on hit, do additional damage - instead modify the damage attribute in the attribute modifier function
		- on hit, increase aoe range -  modify range in attributes		
	- attribute modifiers:
		- range, speed, damage, proj speed, spread (maybe a component?), fire/ice/lightning/chaos/blood/etc damage,
		- I haven't really defined all of the attribute modifiers yet

 
ENEMY BUFF/DEBUFF:

- Enemies need to be made of a set of a components, in the same veins as the tower components explained above:
	- lifecylcles: on hit, on death
	- Attribute modifier examples:
		- speed, spawn occurance, health, size
	- lifecycle component examples:
		- on hit, take -X less damage (armour), also draw a armour icon above the health bar
		- on hit, immunity to slows, draw a speed icon above health bar
		- on hit, cause tower to attack slower for X (time period).
		- on hit, only take damage from certain damage types
		- on death, display different animation depending on killing damage type.
